## Versioning Policy

Nilajs releases closely follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

That means that with a version number `x.y.z`:

- when releasing critical bug fixes, we make a patch release by increasing the `z` number (ex: `1.2.3` to `1.2.4`).
- when releasing new features or non-critical fixes, we make a minor release by increasing the `y` number (ex: `1.2.3` to `1.3.0`).
- when releasing breaking changes, we make a major release by increasing the `x` number (ex: `1.2.3` to `2.0.0`).
